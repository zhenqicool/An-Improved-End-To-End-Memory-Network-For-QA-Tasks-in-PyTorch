# An Improved End-To-End Memory Network For QA Tasks in PyTorch

This repo is the PyTorch implementation of An Improved End-To-End Memory Network model based by [End-To-End Memory Networks in PyTorch](https://github.com/shihan9/MemN2N)




## Requirements

+ [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) ==0.4.1
+ [torchtext](https://github.com/pytorch/text) ==0.3.1
+ [click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) ==6.7

## Dataset

The dataset is bAbI 20 QA tasks (v1.2) from [facebook research](https://research.fb.com/), which you can find it [here](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/).
